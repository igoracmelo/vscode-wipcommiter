# wipcommiter

Easily make and revert WIP commits. 

All commits receive a default message, so you don't need to care about that.

## Features

- Stage current file
- Stage and commit current file
- Commit staged
- Revert WIP commits


## Extension Settings

Note that this extension comes with no **keymaps by default**.

If you want to, you can go to `Settings` â†’ `Keyboard Shortcuts` and search for "wip committer".

Here are some suggestions of mappings:

- Stage current file: <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd>
- Stage and commit current file: <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>F</kbd>
